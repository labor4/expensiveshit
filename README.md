Photo web uploader/iOS homescreen app with Seafile handover

This thing is a small website that serves as a web-app in your iOS device.
It will 
- (pl)upload to server
- hand it over to seafile
- delete the upload

Works for files as well.
Not tested against huge files/upload timeouts (server-side).

To set up:
- You need to rename folder "conf.sample" to "conf" and edit everything inside.
- You need to rename folder "fonts.sample" to "fonts"
